This is a small demo project for 
Sebastian Bergmann's template for PHP projects (1) based on the tutorial 
"Setting up Jenkins for PHP Projects" (2)

How can I use it?
1. get a copy of it (git clone, download...)
2. follow the explanations of the tutorial
3. when configuring jenkins use this project as source

It's not working? 
- Is xdebug available to your php-cli? run "php -i" in the shell and look for xdebug
- try to run the ant process standalone first in the shell
  cd mydemo
  ant
- check out the output of ant, any file-not-found-messages or similar?

Most helpful is the "console output" option in Jenkins by the way. Click on a build, it's in the right menu.
